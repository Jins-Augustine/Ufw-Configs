# Ufw-Configs


## UFW Firewall Configuration Task

This task documents how I configured and tested basic firewall rules using **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux.

---

## üéØ Objective
Configure and test firewall rules to allow or block traffic using UFW.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used
- UFW (Linux)
- Telnet (for testing)
- Linux Terminal

---

## üìã Steps Done

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Checked if UFW is installed and running
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

If not installed:
```bash
sudo apt install ufw
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable UFW
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ List Current Firewall Rules
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Block Port 23 (Telnet)
```bash
sudo ufw deny 23
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Telnet Block
If Telnet is not installed:
```bash
sudo apt install telnet
```

Then test the blocked port:
```bash
telnet localhost 23
```
Expected result: **Connection refused**

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure SSH (Port 22) is Allowed
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Telnet Rule to Restore Original State
First, list rules with numbers:
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```

Then delete the Telnet rule (example shown as rule 2):
```bash
sudo ufw delete 3
sudo ufw delete 7
```

## üß† Summary: How Firewall Filters Traffic
* UFW acts as a gatekeeper for network traffic.
* **Allow rules** open access to specific ports/services.
* **Deny rules** block insecure or unwanted access (e.g., Telnet).
* Rules are tested manually to confirm they work.
* Temporary test rules (like Telnet block) should be removed after testing.
